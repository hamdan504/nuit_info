The extraction process, employing methods such as brine extraction and hard rock mining, comes with environmental consequences.\n\nBrine Extraction Pumping salty water from underground reservoirs may seem innocuous, but it leads to significant water depletion, impacting local ecosystems and agriculture. Land subsidence and brine spills can further contaminate water sources, disrupting delicate ecological balances.\n\nHard Rock Mining Extracting lithium from hard rock deposits, often found in mountainous regions, results in deforestation, soil erosion, and the generation of substantial waste rock. The process involves the use of heavy metals and chemicals, posing risks of water contamination and air pollution."
